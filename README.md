# API WEBSITE PROJECT
## Asssignment Summary : 
#### This a web application that fetches data from a random, free API, and displays it in a user-friendly and visually appealing way using HTML and CSS. The project is done using Vite, and  the API calls are made using Axios with Async/Await syntax.
- API was sourced from Apipheny: [API SITE](https://apipheny.io/free-api/#apis-without-key)
- The Jokes API gets random jokes. You can also get jokes according to type (e.g., programming jokes only). 
- In my Web Application, I only used the Joke API to randomly deliver jokes.
- Joke.js, main.js, index.html, and style.css are used for this assignment (please ignore ~~get_axios.js~~, this was used in a testing phase)
