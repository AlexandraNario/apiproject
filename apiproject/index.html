        <!-- originally I had the fetchjoke() here but a new joke was not provided when pressed.
        When I attempted to have the set the function to return in joke.js so a new joke was provide but then 
      my Connection got momentarily blocked because I was making too many requests at once. I decided having the button 
    be set to refresh the page might be easier -->
